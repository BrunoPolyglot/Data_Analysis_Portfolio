# Project: Danger Alert to Rio De Janeiro's Tourists

## Introduction
### This projects allows me to showcase my data analysis skills and perfom different techniques in order to extract meaningful insights from data. It particularly personal because I come from Brazil and I got robbed in Rio de Janeiro so I thought that I could through data, alert about the danger that tourists might be exposed to. My Tableau's storytelling presentation tries to bring the attention to crimes, in particular robbery and theft of vehicles and cellphone as tourists usually are more exposed to this kind of crimes. My story focus on showing increases of decreases of robbery in Rio de Janeiro from 2010 untill June of 2023. 

## Project Overwiew
### This project focus on a visual presentation on tableau [here's the link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bruno.araujo.de.carvalho/viz/DangerAlerttoRioDeJaneirosTourists/DangerAlertToRioDeJaneirosTourists?publish=yes). The presentation is composed of four slides. In the first one there is the cover page with an illustration of tourism on the right and the danger on the left, in which you can see a fight in the street. 
### In second slide, there is a overview of robbery and theft in the state of Rio de Janeiro to show how these crimes increased before the COVID 19 and then the situation now.
### in the thrid one. I wanted to show how lany vehicles are stolen, many tourists neglect the danger of driving a car. They might think that they are safe but as soon as they stop in the traffic light they might be in danger.
### In the fourth one, I wanted to show what it is the "easiest" way to get stolen. Anytime you put your cellphone out you are probably been watched for someone who is there looking for the opportunity to steal. That might be a pick pocket or a man with a gun. In my case, a man stole my cellphone threating me with a knife. 

## Data Exploration
