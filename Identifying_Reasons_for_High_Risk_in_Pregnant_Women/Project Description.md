# Project: Identifying Reasons for High Risk in Pregnant Women

## Introduction
### This project allows me to showcase my data skills, analysing the data about Pregnant women in Bangladesh. Data has been collected from different hospitals, community clinics, maternal health cares through the IoT based risk monitoring system.

## Project Overwiew
### This project consists in manupulating the data with SQL to see it in different angles and understand the reasons why pregnant women were in high risk. 

## Results and Impact
### In this project, I investigated the data collected in Bangladesh about pregnant women and "36.76%" of these women were in high risk so I wanted to understand why they were in danger. According to the data, all the women with high blood pressure were in high risk but not all the women in high risk had high blood pressure. 
### The data indicates that the high average age of 39 years old might cause a high blood pressure and high blood sugar. However, 102 women in high risk, with an average age of 29 years old had a higher body temperature even if everything seems to be normal. That might be caused by an infection. Unfortunately the data does not help me go further.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned
### The challenge was to ask the right question. "There are women in high risk, but why?" and see the data in various different ways to find the answers. It was an exciting path to understand and learn what was hidden in the data.

## Conclusion
### This exciting project made me feel like a detective looking for an answer. I knew nothing about the body's behavior during pregnancy and each time I saw the data differently I felt like I was learning something new. I was deciphing a code to find out something that was hidden.
